## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

This document will explain to you how to get the BDH script using GIT clone or download the ZIP file and then proceed to instalation on your Linux or Unix Environment.

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- BASH 4.1 (or higher)
- Internet connection (necessary to send alert messages)
- Signed up to Slack and create Incoming Webhook. Read more [here](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)  

### [Installing](#installing)

- Download bdh file in zip format [here](https://github.com/macedojleo/BDH/zipball/master) or in tar format [here](https://github.com/macedojleo/BDH/tarball/master). unzip, and move it to any directory which is in the system PATH.

- Unzip it using unzip <file.zip> for zip file or tar -xvf <file.tar> for tar file

- Move BDH to any directory was set up on Linux or Unix PATH.

- To see all directories were set up on PATH use the command **$ echo $PATH**

- Check if everything is working well using the command **$ bdh -h**

## [BDH - Visual mode](#manually)

The BDH visual mode, displays the disk usage of all FS through the terminal (on the screen). It will "printing" on the terminal screen the following alerts for each FS depending of it usage and the thresholds configured previously:

- **NORMAL** usage (white)
- The disk usage reached to **MAJOR** usage threshold (yellow)
- The disk usage reached to **CRITICAL** usage threshold (red)
- The disk usage reached to **URGENT** usage threshold (flashing)

![Sample](/docs/sample.gif)

### Parameters 

You can use some parameters to display different measures of usage (Kb, Mb, and Gb).

	$ bdh -g or $ bdh -G #Gb Format.
	$ bdh -m or $ bdh -M #Mb Format.
	$ bdh -k or $ bdh -K #Kb Format.
	
	
## [BDH - Deamon Mode](#automatic)

Use BDH in deamon mode to monitor the disks usage automatically through a specific intervall time (in seconds) and send alert messages using SLACK when some threshold is reached.

![SlackMessages](/docs/SlackExampleMessages.png)
 

### Starting BDH in deamon mode

To start the BDH as a daemon process, you should use **- d** parameter and set the interval time (in seconds) which the process will check the disks usage:

	$ bdh -d or bdh -D (interval in seconds) #eg. bdg -d 60 -> bdh will check the disks usage every minute (60 seconds).

Once BDH started as a daemon process, it is recommended to STOP using **bdh -s** or **bdh -S**:

	# Stopping BDH deamon process
	$ bdh -s

### Example of slack messages sent by BDH

- **CRITICAL** alarm message is identified by a :bomb: icon:

![SlackUrgent](/docs/slackUrgentMessage.png)

- **URGENT** alarm message  is identified by a :fire: icon:

## [Log file](#log)

Log files are generated by BDH process only in deamon mode with the name bdh_<timestamp-mmddyyyy>.log. See in the next session [how to configure bdh](#configure) to set the directory path where the log files will be stored.
	
The log file prints information such as START and STOP BDH process besides piece of information about alarm messages sent by the BDH.

	START  |  02/18/19-23:56:33 | Starting process in Deamon mode | PID:  9282 INTERVAL: 3600 | logFile: /tmp/bdh_021819.log
	INFO  |  02/19/19-13:33:56 | FS: tmpfs | Used: 32 kb | Free: 782368 kb | 1%
	CRITICAL  |  02/19/19-15:23:09 | FS: /dev/loop5 | Used: 80 kb | Free: 20 kb | 80%
	URGENT  |  02/19/19-15:23:09 | FS: /dev/loop8 | Used: 100 kb | Free: 0 kb | 100%
	STOP  |  02/19/19-15:23:10 | Process stopped by LEONARDO MACEDO 
	

## [How to configure bdh](#configure)

### [Customize Thresholds]
To customize FS usage thresholds, open bdh script using a text editor your choice and replace the lines below by the values you prefer Remember: All these values were set up using percent format. (e.g. the number "70" means "70%" of FS usage). 

	#set FS usage thresholds here:                                   

	Def_major="70"; #Set value for MAJOR FS usage.
	Def_critical="85"; #Set value for CRITICAL FS usage.
	Def_urgent="95"; #Set value for URGENT FS usage.
	
*PS: This setting will affect both: Manual and Automatic alerts.

### [Configure Webhook App for Slack]
To configure WebHook to allow Slack receives HTTP REQUESTS sent by bdh process, change the variable value below setting URL Webhook you got when install APP using the tutorial at [prerequisites topic](#prerequisites).

	SlackWebHook="INSERT YOUR WEBHOOK URL HERE"

### [Change log Dir]
To change the directory where bdh will write the process log file, Open the bdh script using a text editor you prefer, locate, and change the value of variable logdir as showing below:

	#Change here logdir (log will be generated only in daemon mode).
	logdir="/tmp"
